# Array Flatten Challenge
This repository contains my solution for the next code test:

> Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4]. 
> Your solution should be a link to a gist on gist.github.com with your implementation.
> When writing this code, you can use any language you're comfortable with. The code must be well tested and documented if necessary, and in general please treat the quality of the code as if it was ready to ship to production.
> Try to avoid using language defined methods like Ruby's Array#flatten.

Since it had to be tested I have used TDD to practice and try and produce the cleanest code possible.

## Running the tests
Clone the repository on your local machine and run `$ bundle install && rspec`
